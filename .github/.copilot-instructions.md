### Data fetching and transformation

We use DuckDB for data fetching and transformation. DuckDB is a high-performance SQL OLAP database management system that can be used for data analysis and transformation.
DuckDB is designed to be fast and efficient, and it can handle large datasets with ease. It is also easy to use, with a simple SQL interface that allows us to write queries and perform data transformations quickly. Additionally, DuckDB supports various data formats, making it versatile for different data sources.

Prefer using DuckDB for data fetching and transformation over other libraries like Pandas, Polars or Dask.

## Getting documentation for dependencies

We have the Context7 MCP tool available in the chat interface with the following command. Context7 will provide the latest documentation for the dependencies in the current project.

- resolve-library-id: This command will resolve the library ID for a given dependency. It will return the library ID and the latest version of the dependency.
- get-library-docs: This command will get the documentation for a given library ID. It will return the documentation for the library, including the latest version and any relevant information about the library.
